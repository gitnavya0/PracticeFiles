STL- standard template library
1. Container - stores data
2. Agorithm - procedure to process data, sort, search, etc
3. Iterator - object which points to an element of a container.
iterator connects containers to algorithms.

types of containers:
1. Sequence containers - store data in a linear way (list, vector, double ended queue)
2. Associative contianers - for faster direct access (map, multimap, set, multiset, dictionary)
3. Derived containers - Real world modelling (stack, priority queue, queue)

VECTOR (Vs array)
random access = fast
insertion/deletion in the middle = slow 
insertion at the end = fast 

LIST 
random access = slow 
middle insertion/deletion = fast
insertion/deletion at the end = fast

Associative container - all operations are fast except random access because it is stored in a tree data structure 

Derived container - depends on the container
